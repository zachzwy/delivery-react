4000+ international students/scholars arrive in WashU each year. Many of them choose to buy used furniture. It is a pain point for both personal sellers and buyers to deliver big furniture when making a sale. To address this issue, I gather their furniture delivery data, negotiate and pair them in groups, rent U-Haul for them to solve their problems by optimizing the cost and delivery time.
